# Hypercerts Lexicon Documentation

This repository contains ATProto lexicon definitions for the
Hypercerts protocol. Each lexicon defines a record type that can be
stored on the ATProto network.

## Installation

```
npm i @hypercerts-org/lexicon
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { AtpBaseClient } from '@hypercerts-org/lexicon'
import type { HypercertClaim } from '@hypercerts-org/lexicon'

const client = new AtpBaseClient({
  service: 'https://bsky.social',
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
})

const hypercert: HypercertClaim = {
  $type: 'org.hypercerts.claim',
  title: 'My Impact Work',
  shortDescription: 'Description here',
  workScope: 'Scope of work',
  workTimeFrameFrom: '2023-01-01T00:00:00Z',
  workTimeFrameTo: '2023-12-31T23:59:59Z',
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
}

await client.org.hypercerts.claim.create(
  { repo: 'did:plc:example' },
  hypercert
)
```

## Notes

- All timestamps use the `datetime` format (ISO 8601)
- Strong references (`com.atproto.repo.strongRef`) include both the URI and CID of the referenced record
- Union types allow multiple possible formats (e.g., URI or blob)
- Array items may have constraints like `maxLength` to limit the number of elements
- String fields may have both `maxLength` (bytes) and `maxGraphemes` (Unicode grapheme clusters) constraints
